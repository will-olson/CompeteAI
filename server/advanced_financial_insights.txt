Given the comprehensive dataset, here is the advanced multi-dimensional financial analysis:

1. Market Ecosystem Analysis
The market consists of 414 different stocks that span across various market cap tiers and stock types. The market cap tiers are evenly distributed, while the stock types are predominantly of the 'Stable' type (150 out of 414). 

2. In-depth Insights
The average market cap is around $102 billion, but there is substantial variation, as indicated by the high standard deviation ($310 billion). The P/E ratio, a measure of a company's value, averages around 50.96, with a standard deviation of 171.01, indicating significant variations in stock valuations. 

3. Calculations and Examples
The momentum score, which measures the relative strength of a stock's price, averages around 0.44. Using the formula provided, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) has a high momentum score of 0.99 = (63.11 - 39.35) / (63.33 - 39.35). 

4. Cross-Metric Correlations and Anomalies
There might be a correlation between the beta (a measure of volatility) and the price volatility, given both measures relate to the stock's price fluctuations. Also, high P/E ratio stocks might be associated with high volatility, suggesting investor uncertainty regarding future earnings. 

5. Investment Strategy Recommendations
A diversified portfolio approach is suggested, balancing between different market cap tiers and stock types. High volatility and high beta stocks might offer high returns but carry greater risk. Stocks with high dividend yields might be suitable for income-focused investors. 

6. Significant Trends
a. Momentum investing: Stocks like BMY with high momentum scores might continue to outperform.
b. Value vs Growth: High P/E stocks might represent growth opportunities, while low P/E stocks might offer value.
c. Dividend yield: Stocks with high dividend yields can be attractive for income-focused investors.
d. Volatility: High volatility stocks might offer trading opportunities but carry higher risk.
e. Stability: 'Stable' stocks might offer lower returns but could provide portfolio stability.

7. Why These Trends are Significant
Trends are based on observable metrics like P/E ratio, dividend yield, and volatility. For example, BMY's high momentum score suggests strong price performance.

8. Market Trends and Sector Dynamics
The wide range of market caps and stock types suggest a dynamic market with opportunities for various investment strategies. Specific sector dynamics would need further data.

9. Unique or Contrarian Stocks
'Speculative' and 'Unclassified' stocks might have unique or contrarian characteristics. However, they represent a small portion of the market (24 and 10 stocks respectively), indicating a higher risk profile.

This analysis provides a broad overview, but further analysis would require more detailed data, including sector information, company financials, and macroeconomic factors.
