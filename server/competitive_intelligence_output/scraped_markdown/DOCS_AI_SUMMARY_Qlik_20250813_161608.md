Based on the provided competitive data, here are the key insights:

1. **Market Positioning and Competitive Advantages**: There's no specific information provided about Qlik's market positioning or competitive advantages. However, the high word count for the total items suggests that they provide detailed information through their content. This could potentially indicate a focus on educating their audience, which can be a competitive advantage.
