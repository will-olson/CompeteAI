<div class="block-paragraph"><p>Picture this: You’re ordering an Uber in Lisbon, but your request takes a scenic tour through Madrid, London, and Virginia before confirming your ride. That was the case for millions of users until Uber and Google Cloud set out on an even bigger journey: redesigning how global edge networks should work.</p><p>Operating across six continents, Uber connects millions of riders and drivers while handling more than 100,000 concurrent trips and more than a million HTTP requests per second.</p><p>At this scale, every millisecond matters. When Uber’s existing edge architecture had sub-optimal routing paths, the company partnered with Google Cloud to redesign their global network approach. The results: substantial latency improvements and millions of dollars in cost …

<div class="block-paragraph_advanced"><p>The mission of the Google Cloud Developer Experience team is simple: to help developers get from learning to launching as quickly and effectively as possible. Two of our primary tools for this are the robust hands-on documentation and the ready-to-use code samples embedded directly within it, which developers rely on every day. As Google Cloud's services expand and evolve at a rapid pace, maintaining the quality, accuracy, and coverage of these tightly integrated resources presents a monumental challenge. Modern developers expect instant, accurate, and idiomatic guidance, and anything less ends up being a barrier to adoption.</p>
<p>To meet this challenge, we are strategically leveraging Generative AI, powered by Gemini, in the core of our content w…

<div class="block-paragraph"><p>As the Hawaiian Islands’ primary higher education resource, the <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">University of Hawaii (UH) System</a> faces a unique challenge among U.S. universities: many graduates–including those with deep family roots in Hawaii – are soon confronted with a competitive job market, and struggle to land a fulfilling entry-level role and starting salary commensurate with Hawaii’s higher-than-average cost of living. This risks a continued outflow of skilled young grads from the Islands as they explore other career options on the mainland.</p><p>To bolster its mission of career readiness and workforce development, the UH System collaborated with Google Public Sector to rapidly prototype a new platform for <a href="https://hawai…

### Taming the stragglers: Maximize AI training performance with automated straggler detection

- Published: Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:00:00 +0000

<div class="block-paragraph_advanced"><p>Stragglers are an industry-wide issue for developers working with large-scale machine learning workloads. The larger and more powerful these systems become, the more their performance is hostage to the subtle misbehavior of a single component. Training the next-generation large-scale models requires a new class of supercomputer, built by interconnecting tens of thousands of powerful accelerators.</p>
<p>In these distributed systems, failures come in two flavors. The first, a fail-stop failure, is obvious—a component crashes and goes silent. The second is far more insidious: a fail-slow failure. Here, a component doesn't stop working; it just gets slow. This underperforming node, or "straggler," continues to participate in computations, but its slugg…
