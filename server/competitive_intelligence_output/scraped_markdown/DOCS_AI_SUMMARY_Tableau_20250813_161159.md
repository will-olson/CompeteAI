Therefore, Tableau needs to develop a robust content strategy which includes consistently generating high-quality, relevant, and engaging content across various platforms.

However, as a data visualization company, it's crucial for Tableau to stay abreast with the latest trends in technology and data analysis, and incorporate them into their offerings. This will help Tableau maintain its competitive edge and cater to the evolving needs of their customers.

4. Potential threats and opportunities:
