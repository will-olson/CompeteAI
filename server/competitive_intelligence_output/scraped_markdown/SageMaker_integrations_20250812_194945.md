                learningTextual analysisImage processingBuilt-in algorithms and pretrained models in Amazon SageMakerAmazon SageMaker provides a suite of built-in algorithms, pre-trained models, and pre-built
        solution templates to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners get started on
        training and deploying machine learning models quickly. For someone who is new to SageMaker,
        choosing the right algorithm for your particular use case can be a challenging task. The
        following table provides a quick cheat sheet that shows how you can start with an example
        problem or use case and find an appropriate built-in algorithm offered by SageMaker that is valid
        for that problem type. Additional guidance organized by learning paradigms (supervised and
        unsupervised) and important data domains (text and images) is provided in the sections
