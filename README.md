# StockMarketAI

## Overview

StockMarketAI is a tool designed to analyze financial metrics of stocks, scrape data from various sources, and provide AI-powered insights and market performance rankings. This tool helps users access financial data and get recommendations based on the scraped metrics. The backend is built with Python, while future frontend development is planned.

## Key Features

- **Data Scraping**: Scrapes financial data from various web sources using Selenium.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses OpenAI GPT for generating financial insights and recommendations.
- **Market Performance Rankings**: Provides stock rankings based on key financial metrics.
- **Data Storage**: Stores financial data in JSON format for later analysis.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to modify scraping behavior and the analysis generated by the AI.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Python**: Core language used for backend development.
- **Selenium**: Used for scraping financial data from web sources.
- **Pandas**: Used for data processing and manipulation.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Used for generating AI-powered insights based on the scraped data.

### Data:
- **JSON**: Data is stored in a JSON file format for easy access and manipulation.
- **Chrome WebDriver**: Needed for web scraping functionality with Selenium.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Chrome WebDriver
- OpenAI API Key

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockMarketAI.git
    cd StockMarketAI/server
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 pipenv install
    python3 pipenv shell
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Create `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```ini
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Scrape financial metrics:

    ```bash
    python financial_metrics_scraper_test.py
    ```

    This will generate the `financial_metrics.json` file.

2. Generate AI-powered insights:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will generate the `performance_rankings_financial_insights.txt` file with the market analysis and performance rankings.

## Features

### Data Scraping

- Uses Selenium to scrape financial data from various web sources.
- The scraped data is stored in `financial_metrics.json` for analysis.

### AI-Powered Insights

- Uses OpenAI GPT to analyze the scraped financial data.
- Generates performance rankings and provides recommendations for investors based on the data.

### Market Performance Rankings

- Ranks stocks based on key financial metrics such as P/E ratio, market cap, and EPS.
- Offers recommendations for different types of investors (e.g., those seeking stability or dividend income).

### Customization

- Modify the `financial_metrics_scraper_test.py` file to scrape data from different sources or adjust the data being scraped.
- Change the prompts in `app.py` to customize the insights generated by the AI.

## Sample Output

### Data-Driven Performance Ranking of Stocks

- **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
  - Market Cap: $3.591T
  - P/E Ratio: 36.11
  - EPS: 6.30
  - Dividend Yield: 0.44%

#### Recommendations:
